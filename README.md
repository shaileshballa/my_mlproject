# Student Performance Prediction - my_mlproject

## Overview

This project aims to predict student performance using various machine learning regression models. The goal is to analyze student data and build predictive models that can estimate academic performance based on relevant features.

## Features

- Multiple regression models implemented and compared.
- Data analysis and preprocessing using Python scientific libraries.
- Model training, evaluation, and persistence.
- Simple and modular codebase for extensibility.
- Web interface integration using Flask.

## Models Used

The following regression models are included in the project:

- RandomForestRegressor
- GradientBoostingRegressor
- XGBRegressor
- DecisionTreeRegressor
- KNeighborsRegressor
- CatBoostRegressor
- AdaBoostRegressor
- LinearRegression

## Libraries & Dependencies

This project is built with Python and relies on the following libraries:

- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- scikit-learn==1.6.1
- matplotlib
- dill
- xgboost
- Flask
- catboost

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shaileshballa/my_mlproject.git
   cd my_mlproject
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   env/Scripts/activate            # On Windows
   # source env/bin/activate       # On macOS/Linux
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
